# DreamsLedger

DreamsLedger is an open source, blockchain oriented project which is intended to make a change globally, we expect it to bring the blockchain concept to people who hasn't even heard of it, all of this through inclusion which will be easier by reducing the fees and adding functionality which will make it much more attractive to markets that aren't interested right now.
